# Project "Microservices with Kafka and Spring Boot"

## Description

This project is a demonstration of a microservices architecture utilizing Apache Kafka for message brokering and Spring Boot for developing producer and consumer services.

## How It Works

The project consists of two main microservices:

1. **Producer Service**: Sends messages to a Kafka topic.
2. **Consumer Service**: Listens for messages from a Kafka topic and processes them.

Apache Kafka is used as a message-oriented broker, allowing the producer to send messages to specific topics, and the consumer to read these messages from those topics.

Spring Boot is used for developing microservices and integrating with Kafka. It provides convenient abstractions for creating Kafka producers and consumers.
